# hand_detection (credits)
Project cover detecting hand signal for morse specific detection using opencv based on an existing tutorial created by pramod722445 
on HAND DETECTION AND SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION


## Description
This project is curtailed to specifically detect similar models but read as morse alphabets
Hand sign covers:
+ 1 dot (only index finger)
+ 1 dash (only thumb)
+ 3 dot (only index, middle and ring fingers)
